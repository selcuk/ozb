# ozb
A command line viewer for OzBargain.com.au.

## Installation

This is a simple `bash` script. Simply download it and copy to somewhere on the path and make it 
executable. For example:

    cp ozb /usr/local/bin
    chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/ozb

## Usage
Running the `ozb` command without any arguments will fetch the current **Front Page Deals** 
(deals that are relatively new and have been voted up by the users) and **New Deals** 
(the latest deals, regardless of the number of votes). For example:

    $ ozb
       ___     ___                     _      
      / _ \ __| _ ) __ _ _ _ __ _ __ _(_)_ _  
     | (_) |_ / _ \/ _` | '_/ _` / _` | | ' \ 
      \___//__|___/\__,_|_| \__, \__,_|_|_||_|
                            |___/
